Enable NSLCD for system authentication (also for local users only)
=================================================================

Selecting this profile will enable NSLCD as the source of identity
and authentication providers.

The nss-pam-ldapd daemon, nslcd, uses a directory server to look up name
service information (users, groups, etc.) on behalf of a lightweight
nsswitch module.

More information about NSLCD can be found on its project page:
http://arthurdejong.org/nss-pam-ldapd/

By default, local users are served from NSLCD rather then local files if NSLCD
is enabled (however they authenticate via pam_unix).

However, if you do not want to keep NSLCD running on your machine, you can
keep this profile selected and just disable NSLCD service. The resulting
configuration will still work correctly even with NSLCD disabled and local users
and groups will be read from local files directly.

NSLCD CONFIGURATION
------------------

Authselect does not touch NSLCD's configuration. Please, read NSLCD's
documentation to see how to configure it manually. Only local users
will be available on the system if there is no existing NSLCD configuration.

AVAILABLE OPTIONAL FEATURES
---------------------------

with-faillock::
    Enable account locking in case of too many consecutive
    authentication failures.

with-mkhomedir::
    Enable automatic creation of home directories for users on their
    first login.

with-smartcard::
    Enable authentication with smartcards through NSLCD. Please note that
    smartcard support must be also explicitly enabled within
    NSLCD's configuration.

with-smartcard-lock-on-removal::
    Lock screen when a smartcard is removed.

with-smartcard-required::
    Smartcard authentication is required. No other means of authentication
    (including password) will be enabled.

with-fingerprint::
    Enable authentication with fingerprint reader through *pam_fprintd*.

with-pam-u2f::
    Enable authentication via u2f dongle through *pam_u2f*.

with-pam-u2f-2fa::
    Enable 2nd factor authentication via u2f dongle through *pam_u2f*.

with-silent-lastlog::
    Do not produce pam_lastlog message during login.

with-sudo::
    Allow sudo to use NSLCD as a source for sudo rules in addition of /etc/sudoers.

with-pamaccess::
    Check access.conf during account authorization.

without-nullok::
    Do not add nullok parameter to pam_unix.

DISABLE SPECIFIC NSSWITCH DATABASES
-----------------------------------

Normally, nsswitch databases set by the profile overwrites values set in
user-nsswitch.conf. The following options can force authselect to
ignore value set by the profile and use the one set in user-nsswitch.conf
instead.

with-custom-passwd::
Ignore "passwd" database set by the profile.

with-custom-group::
Ignore "group" database set by the profile.

with-custom-netgroup::
Ignore "netgroup" database set by the profile.

with-custom-automount::
Ignore "automount" database set by the profile.

with-custom-services::
Ignore "services" database set by the profile.

with-custom-sudoers::
Ignore "sudoers" database set by the profile.

EXAMPLES

* Enable NSLCD with sudo support and create home directories for users on their
  first login

  authselect select nslcd with-mkhomedir with-sudo
