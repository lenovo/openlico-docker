# Openlico container deployment

## Introduction

openlico-docker is used for building openlico(include [openlico backend](https://github.com/lenovo/openlico.git) and [openlico frontend](https://github.com/lenovo/openlico-portal.git)) docker image and deloying openlico container as well.


**note: Openlico docker container should be deployed on management node of hpc cluster.** 
## Prerequisite
1. Openhpc, openldap, icinga have been installed in the hpc cluster.
2. Docker have been installed on management node. Please refer to [Install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to install Docker.


## Deploy LiCO in container
### 1. Create image build folder and clone openlico source code

```sh
version=<main>
mkdir -p openlico_container/$version
cd openlico_container/$version

git clone https://github.com/lenovo/openlico.git -b $version
git clone https://github.com/lenovo/openlico-portal.git -b $version
git clone https://github.com/lenovo/openlico-docker.git -b $version
cp  openlico-docker/Dockerfile openlico-docker/scripts/build.sh .
chmod +x ./build.sh
cp openlico-docker/scripts/lico-control /usr/bin/
chmod +x /usr/bin/lico-control

```


### 2. Generate Nginx https certification

```sh
./build.sh --genSslCert 
```

### 3. Prepare script
If the host OS is based on Ubuntu,please update the deploy script as below, 
otherwise please skip this step:

```shell
vi /usr/bin/lico-control
```

**Navigate the ENSURE_PATH globle variableï¼Œ replace the "/opt/ohpc" path with your real hpc module path. For Ubuntu OS the default hpc module path is /opt/hpc, the change is shown as below.**

```bash
ENSURE_PATH=("/root/.ssh" "/etc/libuser.conf" "/etc/lico"  "/opt/hpc" "/etc/localtime")
```
**Modify start script**
```shell
vi openlico-docker/scripts/start
```
 **Add two lines before "lico start --start-only"**

```shell
mkdir -p /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/
ln -s /usr/lib64/slurm /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/slurm-wlm
```

### 4. Build docker image

```sh
# Default
./build.sh 
# To accelerate building docker image, you can use npm mirror and pypi mirror, like following command
./build.sh  --npm-registry <https://registry.npm.taobao.org/> --pypi-url <https://pypi.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/simple> 

```




### 5. Prepare mount folder and config file

```sh
lico-control prepare
```




**Configure /etc/lico/nodes.csv, adding manage node and compute node,like following example**

```

"# We recommend edit this file using Excel or other table editing software."

**Modify /etc/lico/password-tool.ini, configure service account and password**

```ini
[mariadb]
username = "<username>"
password = "<password>"

[influxdb]
username = "<username>"
password = "<password>"

[confluent]
username = "<username>"
password = "<password>"

[icinga]
username = "<username>"
password = "<password>"

[ldap]
password = "<password>"

[datasource]
username = "<username>"
password = "<password>"

```



### 6. Initial data for openlico

**If using mariadb and influxdb inside the container, run this command**
```shell
lico-control init --mode all --inner-db true
````
**If using external mariadb and influxdb, run following command**
```shell
lico-control init --mode all 
```


### 7. Create and run a new LiCO container from an image
**If using mariadb and influxdb inside the container, run this command**
```shell
lico-control run --inner-db true
```
**If using external mariadb and influxdb, run following command**
```shell
lico-control run 
```

### Other Operation:
```shell
lico-control start       #Start stopped LiCO container
lico-control stop        #Stop running LiCO container
lico-control restart     #Restart LiCO container
lico-control remove      #Remove LiCO container
```
